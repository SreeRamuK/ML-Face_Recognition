Data pre-processing:

Images with multiple faces will not get loaded in Data
Only data of the Face in the image will get loaded
size of image data loaded will get resized into specific size


captured image will get tested





Models used:

Random forest, Logistic Regression, Linear SVM and Polynomial SVM



Models will get designed each time you execute the code and this is the reason to take 5 to 6 minutes for total execution.
Model won't even take a second to predict the captured image
